                                                                                     INTERVIEW SCENARIO

Things Pallavi did Right:As Pallavi applied for a job role, She got an interview setup by the HR team and was asked to attent the  
interview by 4:30pm and she attented the interview on time and was patiently waiting for the interview to happen.

Things Shekar did Right:While the interview was stopped in between because of an urgent meeting shekar informed pallavi to come back by 6pm.

The Scenario Where Pallavi & Shekar Were Wrong: Pallavi was not in her typical office attire which is not ideal and when Shekar asked her 
to come back by 6pm to continue the interview she was late. Shekar on the other hand being a manager should not be talking on the phone for personal reasons
when he was supposed to take an interview and is not correct to make a person wait for personal reasons in a professional situation,Since pallavi was already been
patiently waiting for the interview to be conducted and when the interview got started the manager had to leave the interview in the middle and rush for a meeting
which is not an ideal situation considering the process has to be systamatic and well orgonised .

The Ideal Scenario:
As Pallavi was asked to attent the interview bt 4:30pm. She should be attending the Interview on time and should be dressed with proper office attire,
The Manager should be conducting the Interview as per scheduled time and in a professional manner ,The interview must be completed as per procedure,In the 
end the final decision should be told if the candidate is selected or not
